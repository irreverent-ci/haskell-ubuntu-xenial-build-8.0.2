Docker images for a Haskell build environment

SHAs for tracking the build environment used to build your binaries can be found in
`/var/version`.

It differs from most other build images available on Docker in that it comes with
a pre-baked installation of [ambiata/mafia](https://github.org/ambiata/mafia) for those
who want an alternative to `stack`
